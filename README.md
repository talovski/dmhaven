# DM Haven
This is DM Haven — a place to host D&D sessions. It is currently in development.

## Roadmap
- Add character creation form
- Add auth
- Add private rooms
- Add websockets for real-time collaboration
- Add the ability to add homebrew items and monsters
- Expand to Call of Cthulhu and Pathfinder
— Add illustration generated by Midjourney (currently working on the prompt)

## Dev environment
Since it is a pet project, I decided to try new NextJs project strcuture — with an `app` directory and new layouts. So far so good :)

The project was bootstrapped using `create next`, so to run the dev server use

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
